Burpsuite intruder (Educational material rant):
Possibly useful calculation, sadly these idiots gloss over the examples so it’s poorly explained;
`
The total number of requests made by Intruder Sniper can be calculated as requests = numberOfWords * numberOfPositions.
`
To clarify: a wordlist of 80 items, and an attack vector with 2 items (name and password) would be 80 * 2 or 160 requests in total.
If there’s 4 fields, say, for “username, alias, login name, and password” and we have that same list of 80 words, then the number of requests becomes 80 * 4.

Educational content creators, notice what I did there: I took the simple target scenario as a single example, but that is not enough. I CHANGED one variable, (the number of fields) and then showed how that changed the OUTPUT (the number of total requests).
You, as an educator, must identify these dynamic elements that are important because the students don’t know. They’re here to learn, after all. 
So, identify important elements, simplify them, then build up to more complex demonstrations by showing how inputs alter output results. 
It’s not hard, it just takes effort, and I’m sick of seeing lazy work in these sub-par courses where these idiots think one example with NO VARIATIONS somehow is enough. It’s not. 
An isolated example DOES NOT constitute a meaningful demonstration. It’s only by seeing a PATTERN that we can identify what is meaningful and how.
A set of 1 cannot convey a pattern.
